# a3-loscore
My first repository on GitHub

I will attempt to recreate a few underscore functions in an attempt to show how they work 'under the hood.'
This will be my practice as a beginner developer.

1. Create a repository

2. Completed the _.each function

3. Completed the _.map function

4. Completed the _.reduce function

5. Completed the _.first function

6. Completed the _.initial function

7. Completed the _.last function
