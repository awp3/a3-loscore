2. Completed the _.each function

3. Completed the _.map function

4. Completed the _.reduce function

5. Completed the _.first function

6. Completed the _.initial function

7. Completed the _.last function

8. Completed the _.find function

9. Completed the _.filter function

10. Completed the _.reject function

11. Completed the _.every function

12. Completed the _.where function

13. Completed the _.findWhere function

14. Completed the _.some function
