My first repository on GitHub

I will attempt to recreate a few underscore functions in an attempt to show how they work 'under the hood.'
This will be my practice as a beginner developer. First things first, I created a repository for this assignment.

1. _.each function
               <img src="images/00-eachFunction.jpg" width="300">
 
2. _.map function
               <img src="images/01-mapFunction.jpg" width="250">
               
3. Completed the _.reduce function

4. Completed the _.first function

5. Completed the _.initial function

6. Completed the _.last function

7. Completed the _.find function

8. Completed the _.filter function
